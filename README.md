# Contact App CRUD operations


## Welcome! 👋

With this project, I wanted to practice the four basic operations that every web appliaction should be able to perform: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

## The challenge 🦾 

is to build a contact application.

Users should be able to:

- Creating a contact
- Edit a contact
- Delete a contact
- See all contacts

  
## Build with 👷‍♀️

- TailwindCss
- Typescript
- Vitejs
- Custom hooks
- Axios
- ReactJs
- Json server
