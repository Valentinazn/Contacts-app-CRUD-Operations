# Contact App CRUD operations


## Welcome! 👋

To practice CRUD operations, I wanted to create a Contacts app.


## The challenge 🦾 

With this project, I wanted to practice the four basic operations that every web appliaction should be able to perform: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

Users should be able to:

- Creating a contact
- Edit a contact
- Delete a contact
- See all contacts

  
## Build with 👷‍♀️

- Typescript
- Vitejs
- Custom hooks
